  <h2>Song Lyrics</h2>
 
  <p>[Intro]<br>
    Uh...
  </p>
  <span style="background-color:#DAF7A6">
[Verse 1]<br>
Shawty go jogging every morning (every morning)<br>
And she make me breakfast almost every morning (every morning)<br>
And she take a naked pic' before she leave the door<br>
I be waking up to pics' before a nigga yawning<br>
And every weekend my shawty comin' over (over)<br>

Shawty could Fendi out, but she like Fashion Nova (Nova)
She ain't driving no Camry, she pullin' in a Rover (Rover)
With her hair so curly, I love you, baby.<br></span>
    
     <p>[Chorus]<br>
She said, "What you know 'bout love?" <br>(I'll tell you everything)
I got what you need <br>(oh)<br>
Walk up in the store and get what you want <br>(go get it)<br>
You get what you please.<br>
We 'bout to get it on, take off them drawers<br> (I said I love you, baby)<br>
It's just you and me.<br>
You know what I be on, I'm about to go raw <br>(love you, baby)<br>
'Cause I like what I see<br> 
   </p>
    
    
  <p>[Verse 2]<br>
Look, baby, I said I ain't gon' front
You got my heart beating so fast to words<br> I can't pronounce
And I be getting the chills every time I feel your touch<br>
    
I be looking at the top and girl, it's only us
All I need is your trust<br>
And girl I told you once, don't make me tell you twice<br>
I know you see this print through my pants that I know you like<br>
And yo' ass be looking so fat when it be in them tights<br>
And I'm going straight to the top, so hope you ain't afraid of heights<br>
You always treat me right, for a fact, you never left<br>
Through all the trials and tribulations, always had my best<br>
So here's 55 hunnid, go and get your breasts<br>
Start rubbin' on your butt, start kissing on yo' neck<br>
Hey batter, batter, hey batter, batter<br>
Niggas know I had to swing, I had to make a play<br>
I had to apply the pressure, 'cause you my hidden treasure<br>
I think I'm falling in love.
<br>
  </p>
